# 🍲 Taste-enhancing AR/VR

'Taste-enhancing AR/VR' changes how food looks using AR (Augmented Reality). You can see these cool changes on any device with a camera, like VR glasses or phones. This was my project for my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science, and it's about exploring how what we see can change how we taste food.

## 🌟 Key Features

- **Reading Data from ARuCo Markers:** The app can understand special markers to create augmented reality effects.
- **Generating Augmented Content:** It can make digital images appear in specific places in real-time.
- **Camera Calibration:** Adjusting the camera for a more reliable and accurate AR experience.

## 💻 Technologies Used

- **Unity and C#:** Main tools for building the app, chosen for their power and because I wanted to get better at using them.
- **SourceTree for Version Control:** Keeping track of changes and updates to the project easily.
- **Frameworks for Camera and Tags:** Special software helping with camera settings and recognizing ARuCo tags.

**Extra Info:** This project was part of my thesis. It's really about making food look more tempting through AR, to see if it makes food taste better.
