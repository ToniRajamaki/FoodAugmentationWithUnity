# 🍲 Taste-enhancing AR/VR

Welcome to my **Taste-enhancing AR/VR** project! This project explores how augmented reality (AR) can influence and enhance our perception of taste by visually altering food appearance. It was developed as part of my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science, focusing on the psychological effects of visual stimuli on taste perception.

## 🌐 Project Overview

The **Taste-enhancing AR/VR** project uses augmented reality to change the visual appearance of food, aiming to understand how visual alterations influence taste. The AR effects can be viewed using devices like VR glasses or smartphones with cameras.

## 🌟 Key Features

- **Reading Data from ARuCo Markers**: The app can understand special markers to create augmented reality effects.
- **Generating Augmented Content**: It can make digital images appear in specific places in real-time.
- **Camera Calibration**: Adjusting the camera for a more reliable and accurate AR experience.

## 📚 How to Run the Project Locally

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/ToniRajamaki/TasteEnhancingAR.git
   ```
2. **Open in Unity**: Open the project in Unity Hub and let it load the dependencies.

3. **Run the Application**: Press the play button in Unity Editor to run the simulation or build it for your AR-capable device.

## 🗺️ Roadmap

- [x] **ARuCo Marker Recognition**: Enable the app to recognize and react to ARuCo markers.
- [x] **Camera Calibration**: Implement features for proper camera calibration.
- [x] **Real-time Augmented Content**: Make digital images appear in real-time based on the markers.
- [ ] **Improve Visual Content**: Add more dynamic visual effects and refined digital assets.
- [ ] **User Testing and Feedback**: Conduct user testing sessions to gather feedback for improvements.
